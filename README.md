This is a package developed to help you with `ImageField` visualization in your `ModelAdmin`. It automatically creates user friendly thumbnail for any `ImageField` you choose to put in your `list_display`.

All you have to do is to switch from *ModelAdmin* to *ThumbAdmin* subclass. It's super easy to use: 

The Looks
---------
This is how it looks when you hover your cursor over an `ImageField` column:

Usage
-----

Insert **admin_thumbnail** to the end of your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

``` python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'admin_thumbnail',
    ...
)
```

Now, your `ModelAdmin` must look like this::

``` python
from models import ModelExample
from admin_thumbnail import thumb_admin
from django.contrib import admin

class ModelExampleAdmin(thumb_admin.ThumbAdmin):
    list_display = ('an_image_field',)

admin.register(ModelExample, ModelExampleAdmin)
```
    
After that you must create your DB table that manages the cached thumbnails:

    python manage.py syncdb
    
If you're using `south` you'll need to initialise **sorl.thumbnail's** migrations:

```
python manage.py schemamigration sorl.thumbnail --initial
python manage.py migrate sorl.thumbnail --database=$DATABASE_NAME
```

If your `$DATABASE_NAME` is not _default_, and you're using a (DB router)[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/multi-db/#using-routers], you should add a key named `thumbnail` to your database mapping dictionary!

Yes! It's THAT simple!
